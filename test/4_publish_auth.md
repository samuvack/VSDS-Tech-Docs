Authentication and authorisation
====================================

Authentication and authorisation enable secure data publication with restricted access.

In an OAuth2 gateway scenario, the gateway acts as an intermediary, handling authentication and authorisation, issuing access tokens, and granting access based on permissions.

The user is prompted to enter their login credentials, which are authenticated by the [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) gateway. If authentication is successful, the user can access the LDES stream.

For governmental organisations [Access (ACM) and User Management (IDM)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/acm-idm-standaard-aansluitingsproces) can be used.
